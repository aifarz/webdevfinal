                <h2>Who Is Selena Gomez?</h2>
                <br />
                <p>Considered as one of the most successful 'Disney' child actors, Selena Gomez's life can be described as a rags-to-riches story. 
                    Be it the divorce of her parents when she was still a child, or the harrowing destitution that she had to suffer, nothing stood in the way of her success. 
                    At a young age, she decided that she would follow in the footsteps of her mother and become an actress. 
                    Starting off with minor roles in 'Disney' productions, this actor proved her mettle and soon rose to fame. 
                    At the impressionable age of twenty-two, she has already received fifty-eight prestigious awards, for her brilliant performances as both an actor and a singer. 
                    What has made her more endearing to her admirers are the social causes she believes in and fights for. 
                    Be it the welfare of impoverished children in underdeveloped nations, or the protection of abandoned animals, she has done it all to bring about a change in the world. 
                    This spectacular singer claims that her inspiration as a music artiste comes from the famous Bruno Mars, Britney Spears, Rihanna, Beyonc√©, Skrillex, and Taylor Swift. 
                    The latter is a close friend of Gomez, and they are often deemed inseparable by observers.
