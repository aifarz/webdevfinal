                <h2>Who Is Billie Eilish?</h2>
                <br />
                <p>Billie Eilish is an American singer and songwriter. 
                    She is best known for her successful debut single, ‘Ocean Eyes.’ 
                    She was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. 
                    Belonging to a family of musicians, she was destined to make a career in performing arts. 
                    She joined a choir at the age of 8, and by the time she turned 11, she had begun writing and singing her own songs. Her elder brother, Finneas O’Connell, was the biggest influence in her life while she was grew up. 
                    He had his own band and had written a song titled ‘Ocean Eyes.’ Billie performed the song and released it online. It became a massive success. 
                    This turned out to be her first massive breakthrough. 
                    In 2017, her brother helped her record the single ‘Bellyache.’ With the success of the song, Billie released her debut EP, ‘Don’t Smile at Me,’ in August 2017. 
                    The EP appeared on several American and international music charts. 
                    In October 2017, ‘Apple’ named her their newest ‘Up Next’ artist.
