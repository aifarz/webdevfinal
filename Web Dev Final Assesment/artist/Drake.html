                <h2>Who is Drake?</h2>
                <br />
                <p>Drake is a Canadian rapper, singer and songwriter, who has emerged as one of the best rappers in recent times. 
                    He started his career as an actor in the Canadian TV series 'Degrassi: The Next Generation', but soon switched to music, which has been his passion since childhood. 
                    He began his musical journey with a number of self-released mixtapes. 
                    As he gained popularity, he released an EP titled 'So Far Gone'. 
                    He later went on to release four studio albums, 'Thank Me Later', 'Take Care', 'Nothing Was the Same' and 'Views'. 
                    His songs are marked by his egotistical lyrics, often dealing with his personal experiences and relationships with women. 
                    Drake, who had a different childhood than most other rappers of African-American origin, feels irritated at the notion that growing up in a neighborhood with guns and drugs makes his peers more "official". 
                    According to him, his struggles were no less daunting, but he would prefer that people know him by his music, and not his upbringing.
